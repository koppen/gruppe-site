// Atoms
//
// Atoms are the basic building blocks of matter. Applied to web interfaces,
// atoms are our HTML tags, such as a form label, an input or a button.

// Molecules
//
// Things start getting more interesting and tangible when we start combining
// atoms together. Molecules are groups of atoms bonded together and are the
// smallest fundamental units of a compound. These molecules take on their own
// properties and serve as the backbone of our design systems.

// Organisms
//
// Molecules give us some building blocks to work with, and we can now combine
// them together to form organisms. Organisms are groups of molecules joined
// together to form a relatively complex, distinct section of an interface.
